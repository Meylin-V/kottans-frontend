I have already a little bit experience with linux so it was not difficult, but it helps me to refresh my knowledges

I was also familiar with the protocol HTTP, but did not fully understand how it works. Thanks to the material, it was possible to structure knowledge

It is still difficult to say what I will use in the future, since I am just starting to get acquainted with the world of programming. But I'm sure that this knowledge will come in handy, because it's not for nothing that these materials are here =)
