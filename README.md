interesting interactive tasks for studing git


## Linux CLI, and HTTP

I have already a little bit experience with linux so it was not difficult, but it helps me to refresh my knowledges

I was also familiar with the protocol HTTP, but did not fully understand how it works. Thanks to the material, it was possible to structure knowledge

It is still difficult to say what I will use in the future, since I am just starting to get acquainted with the world of programming. But I'm sure that this knowledge will come in handy, because it's not for nothing that these materials are here =)

## Git Collaboration

* [theory 2](https://github.com/Meylin-V/kottans-frontend/blob/main/task_git_collaboration/theory2.png) 

practice

* [practice 2](https://github.com/Meylin-V/kottans-frontend/blob/main/task_git_collaboration/practice2.png)

This part was enough new for me. Automated tests "Travis" are the most interesting of all. I haven't had to deal with this yet. I think that over time I will use everything that was in these materials and, perhaps, even more.

I really like the interactive tasks for studing git. This makes the material easier to digest.

## Intro to HTML and CSS

I used to study a little html and css, so there was not much new. Only adding fonts from google fonts or from a local folder. I think that I will use everything in the future.

## Responsive Web Design
* [flex-practice](https://github.com/Meylin-V/kottans-frontend/blob/main/task_responsive_web_design/practice-flex.jpg)
* [grid-practice](https://github.com/Meylin-V/kottans-frontend/blob/main/task_responsive_web_design/practice-grid.jpg)

As for me grids and flex are not simple themas, so interactive tasks really helped to understend it.
I had met flex and grid before, I knew what it was for, but I had not tried to work with them, so it was essentially new for me.
I also heard about responsive design, but did not know how it was achieved. In principle, it was possible to understand, but it is necessary to try in practice in order to better understand.
Separately, I want to note that the video lessons are very good. Everything is explained clearly and the knowledge is well absorbed)
