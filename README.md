interesting interactive tasks for studing git

I have already a little bit experience with linux so it was not difficult, but it helps me to refresh my knowledges

I was also familiar with the protocol HTTP, but did not fully understand how it works. Thanks to the material, it was possible to structure knowledge

It is still difficult to say what I will use in the future, since I am just starting to get acquainted with the world of programming. But I'm sure that this knowledge will come in handy, because it's not for nothing that these materials are here =)

## Git Collaboration

This part was enough new for me. Automated tests "Travis" are the most interesting of all. I haven't had to deal with this yet. I think that over time I will use everything that was in these materials and, perhaps, even more.

I really like the interactive tasks for studing git. This makes the material easier to digest.

I used to study a little html and css, so there was not much new. Only adding fonts from google fonts or from a local folder. I think that I will use everything in the future.
